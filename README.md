# Password Manager

A simple, secure, and privacy-focused password manager app built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lord Icons**. This app allows users to securely store their passwords locally in the browser's **localStorage** without relying on external servers. 

## Features

- **Local Storage**: Stores passwords directly in your browser's **localStorage**, ensuring that only you have access to your data.
- **Privacy First**: No third-party access, and no data is stored on servers.
- **Simple UI**: Designed with **React** components and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive interface.
- **Secure**: Passwords are stored locally, and the app does not share or send data to the cloud.
- **Easy to Use**: Easily add, update, and delete passwords with an intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across devices with a mobile-first approach.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast and efficient development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **Lord Icons**: For animated, lightweight icons to enhance the UI.

## Limitations

- **Storage Limit**: The app uses **localStorage**, which has a 5MB limit for storage. This may not be sufficient for large datasets.
- **No Cross-Device Sync**: Data is only available on the device and browser where it was stored.
- **Encryption**: Passwords are stored in plaintext. For added security, encryption could be implemented in future versions.
